# Paris 2024 Olympic Athlete Tracking System

A C++17 command-line application for managing athlete records from the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. Records are stored in a custom singly linked list, persisted to CSV, and gated behind a simple file-backed authentication system. Built as a Data Structures & Algorithms (CSE225) course project.

> **Status:** Coursework project, refactored into a modular, cross-platform codebase. Builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Features

- **Authentication** — register / login flow with masked password input, persisted to `users.dat`.
- **CRUD on athlete records** — add, view, search, update, delete, with all changes mirrored back to the CSV.
- **Paginated viewer** — page through records 5 at a time, or jump to a specific index.
- **Two search modes** — unique-key search (ID, name, medal ID) and common-field search (country, gender, sport, etc.).
- **Statistics reports**
  - Per-country medal breakdown (gold / silver / bronze).
  - Total unique participants.
  - Top 5 countries and top 5 athletes by medal count.
  - Most popular sports plus per-event medal counts.
- **Change tracking** — records modified during the session can be replayed at any time.
- **Cross-platform terminal handling** — masked password input works on Windows (`<conio.h>`) and POSIX (`<termios.h>`).

## Tech Stack & DSA Concepts

- **Language:** C++17 (standard library only, no external dependencies).
- **Data structures used:**
  - Singly linked list — the canonical store for athlete records.
  - `std::unordered_map` — user credential lookup and medal-count aggregation for stats.
  - `std::set` — change-index tracking.
  - `std::vector` + `std::sort` with lambda comparators — top-N rankings.
- **File I/O:** CSV parsing and rewriting via `<fstream>` / `<sstream>`.
- **Platform abstraction:** isolated in a single `Platform` module.

## Build & Run

The program reads `data/athletes.csv` and writes `users.dat` relative to the **current working directory**, so launch it from the project root.

### Option 1 — CMake (recommended)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/olympic
```

### Option 2 — Make (POSIX)

```bash
make
./olympic
```

### Option 3 — Direct compile

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o olympic
./olympic
```

### Windows (MSVC)

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\olympic.exe
```

---

## Usage

On first launch:

1. Choose **2. Register**, enter an email and password. Credentials are stored in `users.dat` in the working directory.
2. Choose **1. Login** with the same credentials.
3. Use the main menu (options 1–11) to browse, mutate, or summarize the data.

### Main menu

| Option | Action |
|-------:|--------|
| 1  | View records (all, paginated, or by index) |
| 2  | Search records (unique or common fields) |
| 3  | Add a new record |
| 4  | Update an existing record |
| 5  | Delete a record (by ID or index) |
| 6  | Show records changed this session |
| 7  | Per-country medal statistics |
| 8  | Total unique participants |
| 9  | Top 5 countries and athletes |
| 10 | Most popular sports & event medal counts |
| 11 | Exit |

## Data Schema

`data/athletes.csv` contains one athlete record per row with the following 18 columns:

| # | Column | # | Column |
|--:|--------|--:|--------|
| 1 | Athlete ID | 10 | Medal ID |
| 2 | Name | 11 | Medal Type |
| 3 | Gender | 12 | Medal Rank |
| 4 | Type | 13 | Opponent Name |
| 5 | Country Name | 14 | Game |
| 6 | Native Language | 15 | Event Start Time |
| 7 | Event Type | 16 | Event End Time |
| 8 | Event Name | 17 | Venue |
| 9 | Date of Birth | 18 | Stadium |

The CSV header row is skipped automatically on load.
